# Database Schema Overview
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT * FROM orders;
SELECT * FROM order_items;
SELECT * FROM payments;

# Key Queries and Insights

## 1. Customer with the Most Purchases: Identified the customer with the highest number of purchases.
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_purchases
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY num_purchases DESC
LIMIT 1;

## 2. Top 5 Products by Total Sales (Quantity): Listed the top 5 products by the total quantity sold.
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;


## 3. Total Revenue Generated: Calculated the total revenue from all orders.
SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM products;

## 4. Customers with Purchases Over $500: Found all customers whose total purchases exceed $500.
SELECT c.id, SUM(price) AS total_spent
From customers c
join orders o
on c.id = o.customer_id
join order_items oi
on oi.order_id = o.id
join products p
on p.id = oi.product_id 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 500;

## 5. Most Frequently Used Payment Method: Determined the most commonly used payment method.
SELECT method, COUNT(*) AS usage_count
FROM payments
GROUP BY method
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

## 6. Average Order Value: Calculated the average order value across all orders.
SELECT AVG(order_total) AS average_order_value
FROM (
    SELECT o.id AS order_id, SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS order_total
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
    JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY o.id
) AS order_totals;

## 7. Top 3 Customers by Total Amount Spent: Listed the top 3 customers based on the total amount spent.

SELECT o.customer_id, SUM(p.price) AS total_spent
FROM products p
join order_items oi
on p.id = oi.product_id
join orders o
on o.id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 3;

## 8. Total Quantity of Products in Stock: Calculated the total quantity of products still available in stock.
SELECT p.id, p.name, (p.quantity - SUM(oi.quantity) ) AS unsold_quantity
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi
ON p.id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
order by ## p.id Desc,
unsold_quantity;

## Alternative solution using window functions.

SELECT id, name, 
       (quantity - total_sold) AS unsold_quantity
FROM (
    SELECT p.id, p.name, p.quantity,
           SUM(oi.quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY p.id) AS total_sold
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
) product_totals;

## 9. Orders Placed in the Last 7 Days: Listed all the orders placed in the past 7 days.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 7 DAY;

## 10. Product with Highest Average Order Quantity: Found the product with the highest average quantity per order.

SELECT product_id, AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity_per_order
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY avg_quantity_per_order DESC
LIMIT 1;

## Alternative solution using SUB QUERY and RANK() Function

SELECT product_id, avg_quantity_per_order
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, 
           AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity_per_order,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(quantity) DESC) AS rank_
    FROM order_items
    GROUP BY product_id
) ranked_products
WHERE rank_ = 1;


## Techniques Used
- **SQL Aggregation Functions**: Utilized `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` to summarize data effectively.
- **Joins**: Combined data from multiple tables using `JOIN` operations to create comprehensive reports.
- **Window Functions**: Used `RANK()` and `SUM() OVER()` for advanced analysis without collapsing the result set.
- **Filtering and Grouping**: Employed `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to refine data analysis.
- **Date Functions**: Analyzed recent sales trends using date filtering.
